## FIBO

The EDM Council intends to publish FIBO quarterly on 
[https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo)

This will include 400 Plus files that are all of the 30 Financial Industry Domain/subdomain 
ontologies that have been being developed for many years.

Much of these 30 Domains will serve as raw content to be further expanded and refined by 
Subject Matter Experts using the FIBO Build-Test-Deploy-Maintain Methodology.

Of immediate importance, within these 30 Domains and Subdomains are 8 Domains that have been 
vetted by SMEs, and have passed standard industry Hygiene tests for Web Ontology Language (OWL)
content.

In addition to content, spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo will contain an open source package of 
applications named the RDF ToolKit.
This will enable both casual and expert users to pick and choose FIBO content and how they 
want to visualize and use that content.

spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo and the RDF ToolKit are works in process.

The EDM Council welcomes and encourages participation from users and developers.
